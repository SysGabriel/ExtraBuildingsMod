  EBM_TC.1.d:0 "We’ve completed our latest research facility. We call it, the Tech Centre. \n\nThis building will be very important to us, however, it’ll be very difficult to keep it active with air raids within our country. We recommend that you build anti-air in the state and around it to keep it alive."
  EBM_TC.1.a:0 "Thanks for the Update!"
  EBM_TC.10.t:0 "We need a focus"

  EBM_TC.1000.d:0 "Welcome to your morning news, today the [From.GetName] has shown an improvement in the local economy. After digging, we’ve discovered a building with high technological resources into their core cities, and according to locals, it’s called Tech Centre. \n\nThe Tech Centre infrastructure is surprisingly weak, after inspections, it was proved that the one is pretty vulnerable to air raids and it seems to be very important that it was built with some anti-air structures nearby to prevent it to be bombarded for example. Is [From.GetLeader] currently leading the nation into a better future? or into a destruction? \n\nStay Tuned. This is your secret agent SysGabriel reporting to the WorldNews Magazine"
  EBM_TC.1000.a:0 "Wait what?"
  EBM_TC.1000.b:0 "Keep me Updated!"
  EBM_TC.101.t:0 "A tough decision!"
  EBM_TC.101.d:0 "Our people are currently pleased with our work, now we need to decide what path we’ll follow. \n\nShould we focus on improving our resources or improving our factories? The benefits of each one are listed. \n\nImproving our resources, we can expect better amounts of materials for us, plus a small boost to our engineers when they are working. \n\nImproving our factories, we can wait for more products from our production lines over time, plus better work for our engineers"
  EBM_TC.101.a:0 "Improve our Factories!"

Today the [From.GetAdjective]’s People are praising their leader [From.GetLeader] due to investment into the local economy. After looking with locals, the Tech Centre was being used to improve their factories and resources, which were confirmed by [From.GetLeader] after our meeting. \n\nYes, I managed to schedule a meeting with him to speak about the Tech Centre and the improvements within their economic system, in short, [From.GetLeader] was very assertive about their achievement and improvement to their engineers."
  EBM_TC.1010.a:0 "Oh, this is bad."

  EBM_TC.102.d:0 "According to our Military institutions, we’re improving better than expected. But now we need to choose our focus on the military. Should we focus on Organization, Offense or Defense? The benefits are as follows. \n\nImproving our Organization will be very interesting to our leaders, with a better environment to plan our attacks and defenses plus our army can resist more time in the fight. \n\nImproving our Offense, our army will attack more without fear and our command equipment should be more efficient than the majority. \n\nImproving our Defenses will improve our coordination efforts along with our defense plans. Besides, our armies can resist even better to enemy attacks."

  EBM_TC.1020.d:0 "Hello ladies and gentleman, this is your secret agent SysGabriel speaking to WorldNews magazine. Today, I had to flee from the [From.GetName] after some discoveries about their military institutions. It seems that their Tech Centre was being used to Military purposes and to modernize their planning and organization. I wasn’t able to dig even more due to their renewed security procedures. \n\n[From.GetLeader] issued an order to the local police that try to follow my tracks and take me to prison, but guess what? I was faster and managed to flee into my hiding network."
  EBM_TC.1020.a:0 "What the hell is that?"
  EBM_TC.1020.b:0 "The [From.GetName] can be an issue. Keep me updated!"
  EBM_TC.103.t:0 "The intelligence department!"
  EBM_TC.103.d:0 "Our Agents requested that we improve their institutions. We managed to create some plans for their needs that should improve their agencies. But we need to choose between Improve the agency, Improve our Agent’s Equipment and Improve Our Intelligence Assets. The benefits are as follows. \n\nImprove our Agency will give us better operation organization, so we can do a lot of them without too much risk. \n\nImproving our Agent’s Equipment, will give the possibility to them to recruit more partners and increase the chance of disrupting enemy agents in our country. \n\nImproving our Intelligence Assets, would give us better understanding about our enemies."

A piece of land? Those are the words of honor to join the secret service. It seems that the [From.GetName] has made some ghosts into their Tech Centries, there’s a number of people abandoning their families and businesses to join the SS. I managed to infiltrate the [From.GetAdjective] center of operations and try to guess what I found? \n\nI found nothing, they moved the center of operations into the Tech Centre. I did manage to escape safely however their intel about other nations is pretty accurate, especially with the army templates of their enemies. \n\nAll nations should be aware about their counter intelligence procedures, and improve them to avoid being sabotaged by [From.GetName]."
