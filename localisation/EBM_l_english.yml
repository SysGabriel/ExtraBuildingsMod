After digging, we’ve discovered a building with high technological resources into their core cities, and according to locals, it’s called Tech Centre. \n\nThe Tech Centre infrastructure is surprisingly weak, after inspections, it was proved that the one is pretty vulnerable to air raids and it seems to be very important that it was built with some anti-air structures nearby to prevent it to be bombarded for example. Is [Root.GetLeader] currently leading the nation into a better future? or into a destruction? \n\nStay Tuned. This is your secret agent SysGabriel reporting to the WorldNews Magazine"
